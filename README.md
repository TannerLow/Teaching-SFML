## For N1K  
Start by merging main into your branch  
You can test the program by inserting a row and column for the piece you want to move and another row and column, this time for the spot you want to move to. For example, Row1: 6, Column1: 1, Row2: 5, Row2:1, means move the piece at the position row 6 column 1 to the position row 5 column 1. We are testing on a board with all the piece at their starting spots so this example move would try to move a black pawn forward 1 square. The program will print on whether or not the move was successful. Try test cases that should be valid moves and test cases that are not valid moves and see if the program gives you what you expect. Keep track of tests that go wrong.
